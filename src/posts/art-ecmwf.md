At the time when I'm writing this (March 2021) Covid19 has been with us in Europe for about a year. And just a few weeks before we went into first lockdown, one of the last events I attended was The First Science and Art exhibition at my workplace.  
The exhibition was organized by [Louise Arnal](https://twitter.com/ArnalLouise) and the authors of all artworks were my colleagues and their family members. Around 80 pieces of art from 27 artists were displayed for a week in our Weather room. Who knew we have so many talented people!  

A colleague who knew I did a bit of string art suggested that I submit something, but I wasn't sure, as I was away from that for such a long time. But I decided to give it a go.Nothing to lose and it might be fun. :) The timing was perfect, because I was going to Serbia around that time anyways, so I could bring the materials and tools I needed.  

The feedback was beyond amazing! I actually won a 3rd place ü•â üéâ ü•≥

Little did I know it was the beginning of me going back to string art.

You can read more about the exhibition on [ECMWF website](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/science-blog/2020/first-ecmwf-science-and-art-exhibition).
