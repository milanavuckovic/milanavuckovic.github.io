Hello, world!  
Welcome to my little string art blog. Well, attempt of a blog for now.

I'm Milana, I'm a meteorologist by day and a string artist by night.  
[String art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_art) has been part of my life since I can remember. My dad learned it first, sometime in the late '70s and later it became a family hobby.

Mother of String art was [Mary Everest Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Everest_Boole), a self-taught mathematician who taught children mathematics through playful activities such as curve stitching, which grew into what we know today as string art.

It was a very popular hobby in the '60s and '70 which is when my father picked it up, and it stayed as his hobby for the next 40 years.

For a period of 5 years (2005-2010) it was even a source of additional income for our family. We probably sold close to 3000 of these little pieces. But then my sister and me found regular jobs, and dad continued to make them just as a hobby without pressure of needing to sell.

For the next 10 years I was busy with other things. But with the 2020 being what it was, I ended up having a lot of free time and decided to get back to string art.

I'll try posting here about how that's going.
